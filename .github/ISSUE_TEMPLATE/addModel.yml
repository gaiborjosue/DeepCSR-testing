        ## Recommendations to the user:

        :one:. Include a docker folder inside your project which includes the dockerfile and everything associated with it (absolutely recommended).

        :two:. For your prediction script (if applicable), specify path to the best_model (or weights) and 'sample' dataset at the command line using flags.

        :three:. Please avoid absolute paths in any of your scripts. Ideally, relative paths with respect to the root (project) folder is mandatory in the test-command.

        :four:. This issue's title should start with "New Model:" plus your model's org/model/version.

        :five:. All github urls must point to files/folders in the master/main branch of your repository.

        :warning: Please fill all the details of this form to add your model sucessfully to the zoo. Thank you!

        :red_circle: *If the automatic checks fail, this issue will be tagged as 'failed.' However, fix the issues and comment "Ready-to-test" to test again.
